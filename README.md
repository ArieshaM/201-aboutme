## Pairing 

Great efficiency and learning from fellow students. I selected these two because this is what I really need the most 
as I am learning to code. Peer learning is the best style of learning because it allows you to build a relationship
instead of just casual tutoring. And greater efficiency makes everyone's life a whole lot easier. Less mistakes and more time
to work on projects or parts of the project that matter the most. 

Things I wanted to learn:
How to better work with functions.

I got this information from our readings.
